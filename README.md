I hope that my code isn't too messy!

I intend on fixing this site up once I learn a little more about responsive web-design!

I learned a lot from this project. I had a really hard time organizing all the elements, and deciding what belonged in a box. After completing this project I feel more confident in my knowledge of the box-model and flexbox.

This project took me about 14 pomodoros (25 minutes each)/ a little under 6 hours.

I completed this project after reviewing all the recommended resources from the Odin Project and with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann's Responsive Web Design course on Udemy.

I wouldn't have even had the gumption to attempt this project without synth-mixes. Bless them.
